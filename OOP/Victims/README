One application with cruel operations, having Graphic User Interface and using the Observer pattern
The idea of the application is that you have two mods : A ( you use a database to add, remove, update victims) and B( you are the user of the database, 
meaning that you can add victims in your own database, see pictures of them). Also, you can undo/redo some operations ( mode A for mode A, and B for B)
